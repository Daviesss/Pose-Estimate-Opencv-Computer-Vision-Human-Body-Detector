#Pose-Estimate-Opencv-Computer-Vision-Human-Body-Detector
Human Pose Estimate represents a graphical Skeleton Human .It also helps to analyze the activity of human .The skeletons are basically a set of coordinates that describes the pose of a person . Each joint is an individual coordinate that is Known as a Key point or pose-landmark . And the connection between key points is Known as pair.

WHY DOES POSE ESTIMATE REALLY MATTER ?
 Pose Estimation. We are able to track human motion and activities in real world space. This opens up a wide range  of application possibilities . It is a powerful technology that helps to build complex applications very effectively.
 
 
 APPLICATIONS:
    Pose Estimation has many applications in various fields such as:
    1.Human activity estimation.
    2.Motion Transfer.
    3.Robotics.
    4.Gaming.
    
    
 There are mainly three types of pose estimation models:
 1. Planar Model.
 2. Kinematic Model.
 3. Volumetric Model.

 Categories of Pose estimation:
 1.2D pose estimation.
 2.3D pose estimation.
 3.Rigid pose estimation.
 4.Multi pose estimation.
 5.single pose estimation.
 
 
 We need Two main libaries for writting a Pose estimation code in python:
 1.Opencv
 2.Cvzone 
 
 To install both Libaries above:
 command below:
   1. pip install opencv-python
   2. pip install cvzone
